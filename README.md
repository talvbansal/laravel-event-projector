This package aims to be the entry point to get started with event sourcing in Laravel. It can help you with setting up aggregates, projectors, and reactors. 

If you've never worked with event sourcing, or are uncertain about what aggregates, projectors and reactors are head over to the getting familiar with event sourcing section [in our docs](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-event-projector/v2/getting-familiar-with-event-sourcing/introduction).

Event sourcing might be a good choice for your project if:

- your app needs to make decisions based on the past
- your app has auditing requirements: the reason why your app is in a certain state is equally as important as the state itself
- you foresee that there will be a reporting need in the future, but you don't know yet which data you need to collect for those reports

If you want to skip to reading code immediately, here are some example apps. In each of them, you can create accounts and deposit or withdraw money.
